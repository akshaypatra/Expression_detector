## ðŸŽ­ Expression Detector 

### Description

An Expression Detector is a system that automatically detects and identifies facial expressions from a person's face using techniques from computer vision and machine learning. Its goal is to classify human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc., based on facial features.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Points of Expression Detector

#### 1. Face Detection

-- First, the system detects the face region in the image or video frame.
-- OpenCV is used .

#### 2. Feature Extraction

-- Facial landmarks (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, nose, etc.) are extracted.
--  MediaPipe and deep learning models (like CNNs) is used.

#### 3. Emotion Classification

-- Once features are extracted, the model classifies the expression.
-- Deep learning models (e.g. custom CNNs) is used.
-- Typical emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Disgust, Surprise, Neutral.

#### 4. Real-time Analysis 

-- Webcam or camera feed is used to analyze and predict expressions in real-time.
-- Useful for interactive systems or monitoring applications.

#### 5. Output

-- Displays the detected emotion label predicted by the Model .
